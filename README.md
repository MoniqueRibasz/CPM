Critical Path Method with GANTT Chart and Curve 'S'.
The Critical Path Method (CPM) is a technique used to plan, manage, and analyze project schedules. It helps identify critical activities (which cannot be delayed) and non-critical activities (which have slack), allowing project managers to anticipate risks and optimize execution time.
